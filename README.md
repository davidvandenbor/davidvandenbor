### Art director / Frontend Developer @ Studio VandenBor

I design. I focus on art direction and front-end development using modern trends and skills. I also combine art direction with web design and front-end development on almost all of my projects.

As an art director (and coder) I see myself more as a creative problem solver, rather than a person with a "fixed skills" set. My approach is to go "solution hunting" for clients. I mix and match current tools and techniques to come up with "exact fit" designs or products. It's not a question of: what does a client want? But more in the lines of: what does a client need? I come up with answers that are exact fits to specific problems they want solved.
