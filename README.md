### Art director / Frontend Developer @ Studio VandenBor

I design. I focus on art direction and front-end development using modern trends and skills. I also combine art direction with web design and front-end development on almost all of my projects.

As an art director (and coder) I see myself more as a creative problem solver, rather than a person with a "fixed skills" set. My approach is to go "solution hunting" for clients. I mix and match current tools and techniques to come up with "exact fit" designs or products. It's not a question of: what does a client want? But more in the lines of: what does a client need? I come up with answers that are exact fits to specific problems they want solved.

# Code Snippet Playgrounds

### Visit the **playground** at: https://davidvandenbor.github.io/playgrounds/

An overview page of my code snippets archive, pushed to **Plunker** and **CodeSandbox**. Each code snippet sits inside a virtual "Playground". You can play around with the code: code **updates live in preview windows**! You can also open each Playground in a new larger window for comfortable editing. My playgrounds are individually hosted on Github as repos, and are automatically updated/pushed to the Plunker embeds (that house the Playgrounds). **Plunker** is an online community for testing and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets!

## The reasoning behind it

It became difficult for me to manage my Codepens on codepen.io. There wasn't an easy way to back them up, and there was no archive management or version control. I also wanted to have playgrounds similar to Codepen, but without constantly having to create Pens by hand or maintaining a second parrallel code base to my original snippet collection. With [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/users/david_van_den_bor/plunks) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) I don't need to make "physical" playgrounds. The repo's get pushed to Plunker and CodeSandbox, where they are displayed automatically.

The flow more or less looks like this:
