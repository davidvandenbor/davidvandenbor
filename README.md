### Art director / Frontend Developer @ Studio VandenBor
# I design. I create. I code. I teach.

I combine art direction with web design and front-end development on almost all of my projects. As an art director (and coder) I see myself more as a creative problem solver, rather than a person with a "fixed skills" set. My approach is to go "solution hunting" for clients. I mix and match current tools and techniques to come up with "exact fit" designs or products. It's not a question of: what does a client want? But more in the lines of: what does a client need? I come up with answers that are exact fits to specific problems they want solved.

# Code Snippet Playgrounds

### Visit the **playground** at: https://davidvandenbor.github.io/playgrounds/

An overview page of my code snippets archive, pushed to **CodeSandbox**. Each code snippet sits inside a virtual "Playground". You can play around with the code: in Codesandbox the snippets **update live in preview windows**! You can also open each Playground in a new larger window for tinkering and editing. My playgrounds are individually hosted on Github as repos, and are automatically updated/pushed to Codesandbox previews!

## The reasoning behind it

It became difficult for me to manage my Codepens on codepen.io. There wasn't an easy way to back them up, and there was no archive management or version control. I also wanted to have playgrounds similar to Codepen, but without constantly having to manually create Codepens by hand or maintaining a second parrallel code base to my original snippet collection. With [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) I don't need to make "physical" playgrounds. The repo's automatically get "pushed" to CodeSandbox, where they are displayed/showcased.

The flow more or less looks like this:
